# LeagueOfBuilds
Created by William Smith - 3rd Year Project

League of Builds is a League of Legends build guide tool created using Python, PyQt5, and the Riot Games API.
LeagueOfBuilds.exe is the executable for the application and includes any library dependencies.
main.py and champions.py are the source code of the program.
main.py includes any API requests and creates the main window; champions.py creates the individual match-up windows.
The program was created in a Python virtual environment, so a Python exe and any library dependencies are included in this repo.
src includes any images used in the interface of the software.

!!The program requires an Riot Games API key stored in 'RiotAPIKey.txt' to function!!
